                <p>
                    It was the hard winter she came,<br/>
                    frozen larks plummeting through the gloam like falling stars,<br/>
                    each pail in the yard a slattern’s looking glass.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row2">
                <p>
                    Each dusk, the house cobwebbed by creeping frost,<br/>
                    my husband slipped like a knife from an oyster,<br/>
                    my sons nestled like dormice in their cots,<br/>
                    I stood at my black window and oh<br/>
                    the cold it pressed upon me like a lover,<br/>
                    held its hands to my throat, my knees.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row3">
                <p>
                    She came first through the trees:<br/>
                    a small glint amongst the poplars,<br/>
                    hoarfrost dripping from the velvet nubs of their antlers,<br/>
                    leaping fast to a shuddering pillar of flame,<br/>
                    her pelvis a cradle of jeweled tinder,<br/>
                    her ribs white kindling. A holy thing—<br/>
                    such furious unblossoming—and something profane.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row4">
                <p>
                    I pressed my eye to the glass, the crackling dark,<br/>
                    saw her heart catch light,<br/>
                    blackbirds flap frantic from the forks of trees—<br/>
                    —woke shivering, sweat between my breasts,<br/>
                    my tongue in my teeth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row5">
                <p>
                    Every night then she came<br/>
                    in the stolen hours between caring and dream,<br/>
                    the children vanished, the drudging chaos of day<br/>
                    put to sleep.<br/>
                    I have no words to tell of the shapes she scorched,<br/>
                    the frozen lock, the copper key,<br/>
                    but that heat licked me raw as a wild love,<br/>
                    cracked the ice on my ribs and tossed in a flare.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row6">
                <p>
                    All my life I have been a good woman,<br/>
                    compliant, neat, my children’s snow boots polished,<br/>
                    each snowflake of ash swept clean from my step.<br/>
                    I’ve worn obedience like a uniform,<br/>
                    the hoof of the iron cooling in my grate.<br/>
                    Yet I riled in the witching hour, tongue glittering.<br/>
                    My darling, I whispered to my own dry bones,<br/>
                    for what do you burn?
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row7">
                <p>
                    Three moons she has been absent,<br/>
                    though I wait at my window, the chill persisting, presaging snow,<br/>
                    and my longing rises hopeless as the carp in the pool.<br/>
                    I don’t know where she is living<br/>
                    or if she lives at all—<br/>
                    with women nursing in fevered sheets<br/>
                    or scrubbing floors until their knuckles ignite?
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row8">
                <p>
                    But by dark, when my sons sail the black cut<br/>
                    of sleep, and frost lays its terrible lace<br/>
                    upon the grass, when I am alone with my fretting,<br/>
                    with my dreams like black pearls in the clam of my mouth,<br/>
                    I press my fists to that tenderest wound—my soul—<br/>
                    and Christ how I burn.
